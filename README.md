# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This code implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict stock prices. The code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* TensorFlow
* Keras

## Usage

1. Download the stock price data for the company you want to predict.
2. Save the stock price data as a CSV file with the name `AAPL.csv`.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new notebook.
4. Paste the code into the notebook and run it.
5. The code will train the LSTM model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data.
6. Finally, the code will make a prediction for the next day's stock price.

## Example Output

MSE: 0.0002
Prediction for next day: [157.34]
